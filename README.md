# Reeveli_item_restrictions
Item restrioction system for Arma 3.

Items to be restricted and unit classes that can use the resticted items are defined by their class names in scripts\Reeveli_fnc\Rev_item_restrictions\fn_item_restrictions.sqf
Should there be a problem with the system while in-game the script can be turned off at any time via addon option in "Reeveli's Item Restrictions".

The files included in this repository are meant as an example showcase, as such a few items and unit classes that can use them are listed in teh file mentioned above. The systm is based on blacklisting items that are then allowed for some specific unit classes. I.e. items not mentioned in the script are available for all players, while items that are listed as resticted will not be availbale for anyone unless they are listed as able to use it.

The files included in this repository are to be dropped into an existing mission folder. Manually paste contents of description.ext if needed.

For futher information, question and bug reports please contact Reeveli.
